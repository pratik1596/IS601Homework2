On  7th February 1958, Presidnt Eisenhower created ARPA i.e. Advanced Research Projects Agency which in turn led to the field of Computer Science. In 1960's an MIT graduate by the name of
Dr. Leonard Kleinrock who was a professor of CS at UCLA founded the Queuing Theory. This theory qas used to determine the speed of a network of computers. The theory had two key aspects:
* Demand Access: effective resource sharing.
* Distributed control: no one switch/device should control entire network.

This led to the invention of circuit switching. Circuit switching had its drawbacks:
* If one node is damaged the connection is lost.
This led to a risk in National Military Security in the early 60's.
